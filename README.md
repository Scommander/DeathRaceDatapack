## Introduction

Death Race is a concept which originally comes from [McBirken](https://youtu.be/5jS1Ku63wTs)

This is a datapack recreation of that minigame made for Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+. This datapack includes a randomiser which gives you a randomly selected death which you must race your friends to get. Note that this creation **does not** count scores or when you die. It is purely the randomiser for the sake of simplicity.

## How to Use & Information

You are given a random death at the beginning of each round - first to get that death wins the round. It does not count points automatically due to some limitations of Minecraft - so you should judge what you count as a point and tally your points manually.

Simply type /trigger spin in chat and all players will be given a randomly selected death.
